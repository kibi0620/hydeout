I am a **software engineer** and **researcher**, currently working on SAP Labs Korea as an Software Engineer Intern. I love solving problems and puzzles in real matters :) 


My research interests focus on **Human-Computer Interaction**, especially for data-driven systems and interactions with customization. 
My goal is to build tools that can help people by developing meaningful interactions and systems by user action data. 
Currently I am working on developing better tool for developers in SAP Labs Korea.


I studied Computer Science, Information Science and Economics at Seoul National University.  As a researcher and software engineer, I worked with [Professor Joonhwan Lee](https://hcid.snu.ac.kr) in SNU, [Professor Juho Kim](https://www.kixlab.org/) in KAIST, [Professor Byunghoo Jung](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~jungb) in Purdue University in USA, and Software Engineering Team at [SAP LABS Korea](https://www.sap.com/corporate/en/company/office-locations/korea.html).


I am applying for graduate programs this year. If you are interested, please feel free to contact me via [kibi0620@gmail.com](mailto:kibi0620@gmail.com).
